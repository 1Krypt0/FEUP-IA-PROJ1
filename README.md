# Take the L Puzzle

### Requirements

- Python 3.9

### Building and Running

To execute the program, run `python3 main.py`, while being inside the src folder

### How to Play

When starting the game, the user will be presented with a menu to choose who will play (him or the computer).

If he chooses the computer, he will then be prompted to choose which algorithm to choose and, if applicable, the heuristic as well. The game will show the algorithm trying to figure out a path, and will halt when complete.

If instead the player decides to play, then he can control the direction he wishes to advance to using the WASD keys, or B to go back one move.
